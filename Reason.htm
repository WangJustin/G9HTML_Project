		<h2> Why Michael Jordan is considered the greatest basketball player of all time </h2>

			Five-time NBA MVP; Six-time NBA champion; Six-time NBA Finals MVP; Ten-time All-NBA First 
			Team; Nine time NBA All-Defensive First Team; Defensive Player of the Year; 14-time NBA All-Star; 
			Three-time NBA All-Star MVP; 50th Anniversary All-Time Team; Ten scoring titles -- an NBA record 
			and seven consecutive matching Wilt Chamberlain; Retired with the NBA&rsquo;s highest scoring average 
			of 30.1ppg; Hall of Fame inductee. However, his impact is far greater than awards and championships. 
			He burst into the league as a rookie sensation scoring in droves with an unmatchable first step 
			and acrobatic drives and dunks and concluded his career as a cultural icon. Along the way, he 
			became a true champion who spearheaded the globalization of the NBA with his dynamic on-court 
			abilities and personal sense of style that was marketed to the masses.He was an accessible star 
			who managed to maintain an air of mystique.
