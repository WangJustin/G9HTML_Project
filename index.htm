					Jordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, where he highlighted 
					his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and football.  He tried out for 
					the varsity basketball team during his sophomore year, but at 5'11" (1.80 m), he was 
					deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend,  Harvest Leroy Smith, was 
					the only sophomore to make the team. Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the 
					star of Laney's junior varsity squad,  and tallied several 40-point games. The following 
					summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously. Upon earning a spot on 
					the varsity roster,  Jordan averaged about 20 points per game over his final two seasons 
					of high school play. As a senior, he was selected to the McDonald's All-American 
					Team after  averaging a triple-double: 29.2 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 10.1 assists.
					Jordan was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, 
					North Carolina,  South Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia. In 1981, Jordan accepted a
					basketball scholarship to North Carolina, where he majored in cultural geography.

					As a freshman in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, he was named ACC Freshman
					of the Year after he averaged 13.4 points per game (ppg) on 53.4% shooting (field goal
					percentage). He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game
					against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing. Jordan later 
					described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career. During his 
					three seasons at North Carolina, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting, and added 5.0 
					rebounds per game (rpg). He was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First
					Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons. After winning the Naismith 
					and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one 
					year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. The Chicago Bulls selected 
					Jordan with the third overall pick, after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie 
					Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was 
					because the first two teams were in need of a center. However, Trail Blazers general 
					manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center, but more a 
					matter of taking Sam Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler,
					who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan. ESPN, citing Bowie's injury-laden college career,
					named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional 
					sports history. Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986.

			<h2 id="NBA"> NBA Career </h2> 
				<p>
					Drafted by the Chicago Bulls, he soon proved himself on the court. He helped the team make 
					it to the playoffs and scored an average of 28.2 points per game that season. For his efforts, 
					Jordan received the NBA Rookie of the Year Award and was selected for the All-Star Game.
					1985, he finished his bachelor's degree in geography and continued to play basketball 
					professionally. While his second season was marred by injury, Jordan was breaking new 
					ground on the court during the 1986-1987 season. He became the first player since Wilt 
					Chamberlin to score more than 3,000 points in a single season. The following season, 
					Jordan received his first Most Valuable Player Award from NBA—an honor he would earn four more 
					times in 1991, 1992, 1996, and 1998. By the late 1980s, the Chicago Bulls was quickly becoming 
					a force to be reckoned with, and Jordan was an instrumental part of the team's success. 
					The Bulls made it to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1990 and won their first NBA championship 
					the following year by defeating the Los Angeles Lakers. A rising NBA superstar, Jordan became 
					known for his power and agility on the court as well as for his leadership abilities. He 
					eventually landed several endorsement deals with such companies as Nike, which further pushed 
					him into the spotlight. In 1992, the Chicago Bulls beat the Portland Trail Blazers to win 
					their second NBA championship. The team took their third championship the following year,
					dominating in the basketball world. Jordan, however, had other things on his mind. He lost 
					his father, James, to an act of violence after the end of the 1992-93 season. Two teenagers 
					shot James Jordan during an apparent robbery and were later convicted of the crime. In a move
					that shocked many, Michael Jordan decided to retire from basketball to pursue baseball. He 
					played for a minor league team, the Birmingham Barons, as an outfielder for a year.In March 1995, 
					however, Jordan returned to the basketball court. He rejoined the Chicago Bulls and eventually 
					helped them win the championship against the Seattle Sonics in the 1995-96 season. That same year, 
					Jordan made a big splash in another arena—film—as the star of Space Jam (1996). The film mixed 
					live action and animation and paired Jordan with cartoon legends Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck on 
					screen. The following season Jordan came back even stronger, averaging 30.4 points per game. 
					Starting all 82 games that season, he helped the team finish the regular season with 72 wins 
					and clinch a win in the NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz. The two teams faced each other again 
					for the championships in 1998, and Jordan helped the Bulls beat them for the second year in a row. 
					Retiring after the 1997-98 season, Jordan did not stray from the sport for too long. He joined 
					the Washington Wizards as a part owner and as president of basketball operations. In the fall 
					of 2001, Jordan relinquished these roles to return the court once more. He played for the 
					Wizards for two seasons before hanging up his jersey for good in 2003.
