		<h2> NBA Career </h2> 
		<p>
			Drafted by the Chicago Bulls, he soon proved himself on the court. He helped the team make 
			it to the playoffs and scored an average of 28.2 points per game that season. For his efforts, 
			Jordan received the NBA Rookie of the Year Award and was selected for the All-Star Game.
			1985, he finished his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in geography and continued to play basketball 
			professionally. While his second season was marred by injury, Jordan was breaking new 
			ground on the court during the 1986-1987 season. He became the first player since Wilt 
			Chamberlin to score more than 3,000 points in a single season. The following season, 
			Jordan received his first Most Valuable Player Award from NBA—an honor he would earn four more 
			times in 1991, 1992, 1996, and 1998. By the late 1980s, the Chicago Bulls was quickly becoming 
			a force to be reckoned with, and Jordan was an instrumental part of the team&rsquo;s success. 
			The Bulls made it to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1990 and won their first NBA championship 
			the following year by defeating the Los Angeles Lakers. A rising NBA superstar, Jordan became 
			known for his power and agility on the court as well as for his leadership abilities. He 
			eventually landed several endorsement deals with such companies as Nike, which further pushed 
			him into the spotlight. In 1992, the Chicago Bulls beat the Portland Trail Blazers to win 
			their second NBA championship. The team took their third championship the following year,
			dominating in the basketball world. Jordan, however, had other things on his mind. He lost 
			his father, James, to an act of violence after the end of the 1992-93 season. Two teenagers 
			shot James Jordan during an apparent robbery and were later convicted of the crime. In a move
			that shocked many, Michael Jordan decided to retire from basketball to pursue baseball. He 
			played for a minor league team, the Birmingham Barons, as an outfielder for a year.In March 1995, 
			however, Jordan returned to the basketball court. He rejoined the Chicago Bulls and eventually 
			helped them win the championship against the Seattle Sonics in the 1995-96 season. That same year, 
			Jordan made a big splash in another arena—film—as the star of Space Jam (1996). The film mixed 
			live action and animation and paired Jordan with cartoon legends Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck on 
			screen. The following season Jordan came back even stronger, averaging 30.4 points per game. 
			Starting all 82 games that season, he helped the team finish the regular season with 72 wins 
			and clinch a win in the NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz. The two teams faced each other again 
			for the championships in 1998, and Jordan helped the Bulls beat them for the second year in a row. 
			Retiring after the 1997-98 season, Jordan did not stray from the sport for too long. He joined 
			the Washington Wizards as a part owner and as president of basketball operations. In the fall 
			of 2001, Jordan relinquished these roles to return the court once more. He played for the 
			Wizards for two seasons before hanging up his jersey for good in 2003.
