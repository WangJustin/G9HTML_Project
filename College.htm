		<h2> College </h2>
		<p> 
			As a freshman in coach Dean Smith&rsquo;s team-oriented system, he was named ACC Freshman
			of the Year after he averaged 13.4 points per game (ppg) on 53.4% shooting (field goal
			percentage). He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game
			against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing. Jordan later 
			described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career. During his 
			three seasons at North Carolina, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting, and added 5.0 
			rebounds per game (rpg). He was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First
			Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons. After winning the Naismith 
			and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one 
			year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. The Chicago Bulls selected 
			Jordan with the third overall pick, after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie 
			Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was 
			because the first two teams were in need of a center. However, Trail Blazers general 
			manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center, but more a 
			matter of taking Sam Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler,
			who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan. ESPN, citing Bowie&rsquo;s injury-laden college career,
			named the Blazers&rsquo; choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional 
			sports history. Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986.
