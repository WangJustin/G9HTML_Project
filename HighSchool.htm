		<h2> High School </h2>
		<p> 
			Jordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, where he highlighted 
			his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and football.  He tried out for 
			the varsity basketball team during his sophomore year, but at 5&rsquo;11&rdquo (1.80 m), he was 
			deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend,  Harvest Leroy Smith, was 
			the only sophomore to make the team. Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the 
			star of Laney&rsquo;s junior varsity squad,  and tallied several 40-point games. The following 
			summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously. Upon earning a spot on 
			the varsity roster,  Jordan averaged about 20 points per game over his final two seasons 
			of high school play. As a senior, he was selected to the McDonald&rsquo;s All-American 
			Team after  averaging a triple-double: 29.2 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 10.1 assists.
			Jordan was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, 
			North Carolina,  South Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia. In 1981, Jordan accepted a
			basketball scholarship to North Carolina, where he majored in cultural geography.
