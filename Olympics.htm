				<h2> Olympic Career </h2>
				<p>
					Jordan played on two Olympic gold medal-winning American basketball teams. He won a gold medal 
					as a college player in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The team was coached by Bob Knight and featured 
					players such as Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, Steve Alford, and Wayman Tisdale. 
					Jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament. In the 1992 Summer 
					Olympics, he was a member of the star-studded squad that included Magic Johnson, Larry Bird,
					and David Robinson and was dubbed the "Dream Team". Jordan was the only player to start all 8 
					games in the Olympics. Playing limited minutes due to the frequent blowouts, Jordan averaged 14.9 
					ppg, finishing second on the team in scoring. Jordan and fellow Dream Team members Patrick 
					Ewing and Chris Mullin are the only American men's basketball players to win Olympic gold medals as 
					amateurs and professionals.
