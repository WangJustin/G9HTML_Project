			After his third retirement, Jordan assumed that he would be able to return to his front office
			position as Director of Basketball Operations with the Wizards. However, his previous tenure
			in the Wizards&rsquo; front office had produced the aforementioned mixed results and may have also 
			influenced the trade of Richard "Rip" Hamilton for Jerry Stackhouse (although Jordan was not 
			technically Director of Basketball Operations in 2002). On May 7, 2003, Wizards owner Abe 
			Pollin fired Jordan as Washington&rsquo;s President of Basketball Operations. Jordan later stated
			that he felt betrayed, and that if he knew he would be fired upon retiring he never would have 
			come back to play for the Wizards. Jordan kept busy over the next few years. He stayed in shape,
			played golf in celebrity charity tournaments, and spent time with his family in Chicago. He also
			promoted his Jordan Brand clothing line and rode motorcycles. Since 2004, Jordan has owned
			Michael Jordan Motorsports, a professional closed-course motorcycle road racing team that competed
			with two Suzukis in the premier Superbike championship sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist
			Association (AMA) until the end of the 2013 season. In 2006, Jordan and his wife Juanita 
			pledged $5 million to Chicago&rsquo;s Hales Franciscan High School. The Jordan Brand has made donations 
			to Habitat for Humanity and a Louisiana branch of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.
